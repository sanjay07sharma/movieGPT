# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

        extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
    }
`

### Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS

index.css
`
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
`
Start your build process
Run your build process with npm run start.

## Adding OpenAI Integration for Movie Recommendations

To enhance the movie recommendation feature in your application,
follow these steps to integrate OpenAI's GPT model into the `GptSearchBar` component.
This will allow users to receive movie suggestions directly from the OpenAI API.

1. **Integrate OpenAI API in `GptSearchBar.js`:**
   - Modify `GptSearchBar.js` to include functionality for fetching movie suggestions from the OpenAI API.
   - Implement input handling for initiating API calls upon user interaction.

2. **Handle Search Input and Button Clicks:**
   - Add a search input field and a button in the `GptSearchBar` component.
   - Implement `handleGptSearchClick` function to process user input and initiate
   a fetch request to the OpenAI API for movie recommendations.

3. **Update `package.json`:**
   - Add the OpenAI SDK to your project dependencies by running
   `npm install openai@^4.52.3` or adding `"openai": "^4.52.3"` manually to your `package.json` file.

4. **Create an OpenAI Utility File:**
   - Create a utility file named `openAi.js` in your utilities folder.
   - Initialize the OpenAI SDK with your API key in this file.

5. **Update Project Configuration:**
   - Ensure that your `package-lock.json` is updated with the newly added dependencies by running `npm install`.
   - Add your OpenAI API key to a constants file (e.g., `constants.js`).
   Make sure to name the constant `OPENAI_KEY` and keep it secure.

6. **Implementing the Feature:**
   - Use the search input to capture user queries.
   - Upon clicking the search button, use the `handleGptSearchClick`
   function to send the query to the OpenAI API and fetch suggestions.
   - Log the results to the console for further processing or directly display them in your UI.

This integration allows the `GptSearchBar` component to leverage OpenAI's powerful GPT-3.5 model
for generating on-demand movie recommendations, enhancing the user experience by providing personalized suggestions.


### Anthropic AI SDK integration

1. **Add Anthropic AI SDK to dependencies**
   - Added `@anthropic-ai/sdk` version `^0.24.3` to `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
   - Updated `GptSearchBar.js` to use the Anthropic API for movie recommendations.

2. **Integrate Anthropic API in GptSearchBar component**
   - Replaced OpenAI API calls with Anthropic API for fetching movie suggestions.
   - Initialized Anthropic client with API key from `constants.js`.

3. **Update GptSearchBar styling and functionality**
   - Added semicolons and formatted code for consistency.
   - Improved API call handling and error logging.
   - Updated movie search logic to trim movie names.

4. **Store Anthropic API key in constants**
   - Added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `constants.js` for secure access in API calls.
